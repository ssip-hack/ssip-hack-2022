Historical data is used to create the predictive model. In general case, we call it a regressor, classifier. Which captures the important trends, and then it will generate the predictions based on their historical data.

Steps

1. Data Exploration - exploring, and learning the data

2. Data cleansing - Reemoving null, missing and redundant variables

3.Modelling - Selecting the prediction model
- Taking the variables which are related continuosly

4. Evaluation - Checking the accuracy of the model
- Improve the performance and increasing the data prediction
