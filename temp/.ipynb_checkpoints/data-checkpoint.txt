Aim: Student dropout analysis
----
Abstract: Data provide -> Analyse -> Prediction

Analyse - Dropout ratio > beneficiary work increase
					Prediction -> Dropout chances high then personalised approach to that student

Benefit - Student dropout ratio decrease, and performance, skills and education will increase

Tools & Technologies - Python, MS Excel, Pandas & Machine learning libraries

Approach - Machine learning models are trained on the pre-existing data, and analysed using different perspectives. Prediction models are created for each new data entry, and tested upon dataframes.

Features - Dataset analysing, Predictions and accurate information about dropout of students. The data can be used to improve the existing education system, and overcome the barriers of the current system.

Future - Future of the prediction system is brighten as it will be more beneficiary to the education system. As datasets will become more and more accurate - it will be become more benefitial to the students. The dropout rate will decreased thus, the education rate will be improvised.
